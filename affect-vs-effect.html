<h2>Affect or Effect, Which to choose?</h2>
<blockquote>
Affect is the more common of the two verbs, so thechances are that it will be the right word if you are looking for averb. However, if your sentence contains a word like 'change','transformation', 'improvement' then it is likely to be preceded byeffect, i.e. 'bring about'. When it’s the noun you want, effect will almostcertainly be right (since the rarely found affect has the specialist,psychological sense of 'emotion' or 'desire'). But knowing whetheryou are looking for noun or verb depends on knowing parts ofspeech . . . There’s no shortcut here.</blockquote>
