<p>Empathy is 'imaginative identification with someone else' and his orher situation, whether that situation is a good or bad one.</p>
<blockquote>
Examples</blockquote>
<p>■ Your Friend was mad because he got an F in math test. You also had an F in math test , so u have empathy for your friend.</p>
<p>■ Stella told the teacher that she did not like the troubled main characters in the book because she did not have empathy for them.</p>
<p>■ As I had lost my job last year, I had empathy for my friend when she was fired.</p>
<p>■ She has empathy for those struggling with addiction since she is a recovering addict.</p>
<p>■ I did not have empathy for the characters.</p>
<p>■ It is important to be a good listener and show empathy with the individual's situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sympathy">

<blockquote>
Examples</blockquote>
<p>■ I've received too much sympathy in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>■ I offer my deepest sympathy to his family, also to the band which I hope will carry on, given time to reflect.</p>
<p>■ Your Friend was mad because he got an F in math test. You got B in math test . You offer sympathy to your friend because no one likes to fail.</p>
<p>■ The class sent a sweet letter of sympathy to the teacher when her husband passed away.
We didn't expect a sympathy vote in the election, but, happily, the underdog won.</p>
<p>■ Jo had never been dumped, but she had real sympathy for her friend who was going through a bad breakup.</p>
<p>■ We felt such sympathy for our neighbors who lost everything in the wildfires and donated what we could.</p>
