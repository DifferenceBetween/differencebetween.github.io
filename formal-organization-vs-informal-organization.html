<h2>Formal Organization</h2>
<p>The formal Organization has a structure that is consciously designed to enable the people of the organization to work together for accomplishing common objectives. Thus, formal Organization is more or less arbitrary structure to which the individual must adjust. It tells individual members to do certain things in specific manner to obey orders from designated individuals and to cooperate with others. Coordination also proceeds according to a prescribed pattern in the formal Organization structure.</p>
<p>The formal Organization is built on certain principles, i.e. around four key pillars, namely, (a) division of labor, i.e. the whole work is divided into a number of small operations and each operation is performed by a different person so that there is maximum specialization; (b) scalar and functional processes, which implies that the Organization grows both vertically and horizontally, (c) structure, which refers to the overall arrangement ensuring proper balance between different parts of the organization and secures the execution of all operations and the achievement of organizational objectives; and (d) span of control, refers to the number of subordinates directly reporting and accountable to one superior. According to Koontz and Weitirich- Formal organization means the intentional structure of roles in a formally organized enterprise.</p>

<div class="section" id="informal-organization">
<h2>Informal Organization</h2>
<p>Informal organizations refers to the relationship between people in the organization based on personal attitudes, emotions, prejudices, likes, dislikes, etc. These relations are not developed according to procedures and regulations laid down in the formal organization structure; generally large formal groups give rise to small informal groups. These groups are not preplanned; rather develop automatically/spontaneously according to the organizational environment.</p>
<p>No organization operates completely by the book. In real settings, the relationship that actually exists among employees in an organization does not follow formal lines. Employees in one department know those in other departments. They may need information about the acts of indiscipline in a particular department or some advice on delicate matters regarding the handling of jobs, etc. The associations of persons, in such cases, come under informal organization. These associations may be among employees on the same level of the hierarchy or on different levels.</p>
<p>The communication in informal organization is very fast and efficient. If handled properly, it helps in forming the activities of the organization very efficiently and effectively. Informal organization may act to fill gaps in management‘s abilities. It also helps in mediating breaches in understanding between the management and the employees. Informal organizations influence productivity and job-satisfaction. It delineates avenues of promotion and points out ‗dead-end‘ jobs. It makes for closer cooperation and higher morale. It brings to the members of a formal organization a feeling of belongingness, of status, of  self-respect/esteem, and of gregarious satisfaction.</p>
