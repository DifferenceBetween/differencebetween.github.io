<h2>Maslow's Need Hierarchy</h2>
<p>It is simply known as need hierarchy theory. This theory was proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper <strong>A Theory of Human Motivation</strong>. His theory suggests that people must satisfy five group of needs in order-physiological, security, social, esteem and self-actualization. The basis of Maslow's theory of motivation is that human beings are motivated by unsatisfied needs, and that certain lower needs need to be satisfied before higher needs can be addressed. These needs can be arranged in a hierarchy called 'Maslow's Needs Pyramid' or 'Maslow's Needs Triangle'. A person progresses step-by-step up this hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alderfer-s-erg-theory">
<h2>Alderfer's ERG Theory</h2>
<p>Clayton Alderfer proposed this theory. The letter <strong>E</strong>, <strong>R</strong> and <strong>G</strong> stand for existence, relatedness and growth. This theory collapse the need hierarchy developed by Maslow into three levels. <strong>Existence needs</strong>: They correspond to the physiological and security needs. They represent Maslow‘s fundamental needs. <strong>Relatedness needs</strong>: They focus on how people relate to their social environment. They represent needs for interpersonal relations. In Maslow's hierarchy, they would encompass both the need to belong and the need to earn esteem of others. <strong>Growth needs</strong>: They include needs for self-esteem, self-actualization, personal creativity or productive influence. They are the highest level needs in Alderfer's schema.</p>
