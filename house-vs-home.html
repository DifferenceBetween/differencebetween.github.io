        <p>The main difference between house and home is House refers to a building where a people live whereas Home talks about where you live or where someone lives. A home can even be something abstract, a place in your mind. When you say, “Let’s go home,” you are probably not talking simply about going to the physical structure where you live. You are talking about being in the special place where you feel most comfortable and that belongs to you.</p>

<p>It’s eaves and chimneys</p>

<p>What is a Home?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s loving and family</p>
<p>and doing for others.</p>
<p>It’s brothers and sisters</p>

<p>It’s unselfish acts</p>

<p>and showing your loved ones</p>
<p>you’re always caring.”</p>
