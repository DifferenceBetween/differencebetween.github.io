<h2>What is the difference between House and Home?</h2>
<p>The main difference between house and home is House refers to a building where a people live whereas Home talks about where you live or where someone lives. A home can even be something abstract, a place in your mind. When you say, “Let’s go home,” you are probably not talking simply about going to the physical structure where you live. You are talking about being in the special place where you feel most comfortable and that belongs to you.</p>
<p><strong>A House is made to be a home but A house is not necessarily nor automatically a home</strong></p>
<img alt="Difference Between House and Home(House vs Home)" id="id1" src="theme/img/DifferenceBetween/house-vs-home.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>In some languages House and Home are expressed with the same word(e.g., French maison, Spanish casa). In English and many other languages these concepts can be distinguished from each other (e.g., Swedish hus, hem, Finnish talo, koti). The idea of home is not necessarily connected with a house. In practice, many fims see home as place, most concretely as a house, apartment, or at least as a room. Furthermore, Home is specified as furniture and objects in it, which can be taken along to the next place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="house">
<h2>House</h2>
<p>A House is a building for human habitation, especially one that consists of a ground floor and one or more upper storeys. House is made when you build a building which can give us a shelther. Housing like home is also about human relations, doing and activity, it has its material side, too - buildings, rooms, objects.</p>
<p>A house is a physical structure providing shelter and a set of more or less functional spaces to undertake activities of daily living. It is a location from which we customarily venture forth and to which we return, often on a daily basis, as we engage in the cycle of work, rest, and play.</p>
<p><strong>House do not capture the complex socio-spatial relations and emotions that define home.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="home">
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>Homes are not merely practical as a place of shelter but also have a symbolic function in terms of the way we want to display our identies and convey meaning. Homes are more than simple bricks and mortar. Home occupies a space in which we imbune our feelings and aspirations in relation to self-identity and also in relation to others and the environment. Home not only comprises a sense of place but also a broad set of feelings. Home is a place and an idea, where the decisive point is that you feel it is your home. In English research literature, there have been attempts to capture this with concepts such as feeling at home, sense of belonging, desire of intimace. The notion of home is far more emotionally loaded and evocative. Home is a sense of being at one with the world that is manifest experimentally.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
        <p>
        At times home is nowhere. At times one knows only extreme estrangement and alienation. Then home is no longer just one place. It is locations. Home is that place which enables and promotes varied and everchanging perspectives, a place where one discovers new ways of seeing reality, frontiers of difference.
