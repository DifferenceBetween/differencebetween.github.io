<h2>Leader</h2>
<p>It is clear that leadership is pervasive and not just reserved for the appointed ones, Everyone can demonstrate leadership, whether it be as a parent, teacher, friend, team leader or organizational leader. Leadership defines what the future should look like, aligns people with that vision and inspires them to make it happen despite the obstacles. Leader is a person who, by word and/or by personal example, markedly influence the behaviours, thoughts and feelings of a significant number of their fellow human beings. Leadership is function of knowing yourself, having a vision that is well communicated, building trust, among colleagues, and taking effective action to realize your own leadership potential.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="manager">
<h2>Manager</h2>
<p>A manager is a person who manages the organization and is responsible for planning, direction, coordination and control. When managers are relationally cometent they inspire a willingness to cooperate. People feel valued and good about themselves. I have heard people say they would do practically anything for this type of manager. In a team where a more collborative apprach prevails, people feel more committed, and creativity can flourish.</p>
