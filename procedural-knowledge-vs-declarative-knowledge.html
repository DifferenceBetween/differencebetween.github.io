<h2>Procedural Knowledge</h2>
<p>Procedural knowledge is the type of knowledge someone has and demonstrates through the procedure of doing something. For example, the steps used to solve algebraic equations. Thus procedural knowledge (the knowledge of how, and especially how best, to perform some task), is related to the procedure to carry an action out. Knowledge about “how to do something” is procedural knowledge. It is instruction-oriented. It focuses on how to obtain a result.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="declarative-knowledge">
<h2>Declarative Knowledge</h2>
<p>Declarative knowledge is the type of knowledge that is expressed in declarative sentences or indicative propositions. Declarative knowledge is factual knowledge. For example, knowing that “A cathode ray tube is used to project a picture in most televisions.” is a declarative knowledge. When we say things like &quot;I know that the internal angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees&quot; or &quot;I know that it was you that ate my sandwich&quot;, we are claiming to have propositional knowledge. It is also known as descriptive knowledge or propositional knowledge. It is the knowledge which describes how things are. It is assertion 1 -oriented and focuses on describing the properties.</p>
