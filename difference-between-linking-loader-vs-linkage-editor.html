<h2>Linking Loader</h2>
<p>Linking Loader performs all linking and relocation operations, including automatic library search, and loads the linked program into memory for execution. The algorithm for a linking loader is considerably more complicated than the absolute loader algorithm. A linking loader usually makes two passes over its input, just as an assembler does. In terms of general function, the two passes of a linking loader are quite similar to the two passes of an assembler:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pass 1 assigns addresses to all external symbols. </p>
<p>Pass 2 performs the actual loading, relocation, and linking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main data structure needed for our linking loader is an external symbol table <strong>ESTAB</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) This table, which is analogous to SYMTAB in our assembler algorithm,
is used to store the name and address of each external symbol in the
set of control sections being loaded.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>A hashed organization is typically used for this table.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Two other important variables are PROGADDR (program load address) and CSADDR (control section address):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) PROGADDR is the beginning address in memory where the linked program
is to be loaded. Its value is supplied to the loader by the OS.</p>
<p>(2) CSADDR contains the starting address assigned to the control section
currently being scanned by the loader. This value is added to all relative
addresses within the control section to convert them to actual addresses.</p>
</blockquote>
<img alt="Linking Loader" id="id2" src="theme/img/DifferenceBetween/linking-loader.png" style="width: 100%;" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="linkage-editor">
<h2>Linkage Editor</h2>
<p>The linkage editor performs relocation of all control sections relative to the
start of the linked program. Thus, all items that need to be modified at load
time have values that are relative to the start of the linked program. <strong>This means that the loading can be accomplished in one pass with no external symbol table required.</strong></p>
<p>If a program is to be executed many times without being reassembled, the
use of a linkage editor substantially reduces the overhead required. Linkage editors can perform many useful functions besides simply
preparing an object program for execution.</p>
<p>Ex., a typical sequence of
linkage editor commands used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>INCLUDE PLANNER (PROGLIB)</p>
<p>DELETE PROJECT {<strong>delete from existing PLANNER</strong>}</p>
<p>INCLUDE PROJECT (NEWLIB) {<strong>include new version</strong>}</p>
<p>REPLACE PLANNER (PROGLIB)</p>
</blockquote>
<img alt="Linkage Editor" id="id3" src="theme/img/DifferenceBetween/linkage-editor.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>Linkage editors can also be used to build packages of subroutines or other control sections that are generally used together. This can be useful when dealing with subroutine libraries that support high-level programming languages. Linkage editors often include a variety of other options and commands like those discussed for linking loaders. Compared to linking loaders, linkage
editors in general tend to offer more flexibility and control.</p>
<p>The execution of any program needs four basic functionalities and those are
allocation, relocation, linking and loading. As we have also seen in direct
linking loader for execution of any program each time these four
functionalities need to be performed.</p>
<p>But performing all these functionalities each time is time and space consuming task. Moreover if
the program contains many subroutines or functions and the program
needs to be executed repeatedly then this activity becomes annoyingly
complex .Each time for execution of a program, the allocation, relocation
linking and -loading needs to be done. Now doing these activities each
time increases the time and space complexity. Actually, there is no need
to redo all these four activities each time. Instead, if the results of some of
these activities are stored in a file then that file can be used by other
activities. And performing allocation, relocation, linking and loading can
be avoided each time.</p>
<p>The idea is to separate out these activities in
separate groups. Thus dividing the essential four functions in groups
reduces the overall time complexity of loading process. The program
which performs allocation, relocation and linking is called binder. The
binder performs relocation, creates linked executable text and stores this
text in a file in some systematic manner. Such kind of module prepared
by the binder execution is called load module. This load module can then
be actually loaded in the main memory by the loader. This loader is also
called as module loader. If the binder can produce the exact replica of
executable code in the load module then the module loader simply loads
this file into the main memory which ultimately reduces the overall time
complexity.</p>
<p>But in this process the binder should knew the current
positions of the main memory. Even though the binder knew the main
memory locations this is not the only thing which is sufficient. In
multiprogramming environment, the region of main memory available for
loading the program is decided by the host operating system. The binder
should also know which memory area is allocated to the loading program
and it should modify the relocation information accordingly. The binder</p>
