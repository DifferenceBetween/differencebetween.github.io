<h2>What is the main difference between forward chaining and backward chaining?</h2>
<p>The main difference between forward chaining and backward chaining is Forward chaining starts with the available data and uses inference rules to extract more data (from an end user for example) until a goal is reached whereas Backward chaining (or backward reasoning) is an inference method that can be described as working backward from the goal(s). Forward Chaining starts with available data. Backward chaining starts with the list of goals.</p>

<h2>Forward Chaining</h2>
<p>Forward chaining starts with the available data and uses inference rules to extract more data (from an end user for example) until a goal is reached. An inference engine using forward chaining searches the inference rules until it finds one where the antecedent 5 (If clause) is known to be true. When found it can conclude, or infer, the consequent (Then clause), resulting in the addition of new information to its data. Inference engines will iterate through this process until a goal is reached.</p>

<div class="section" id="backward-chaining">
<h2>Backward Chaining</h2>
<p>Backward chaining (or backward reasoning) is an inference method that can be described as working backward from the goal(s). It is used in automated theorem provers, proof assistants and other artificial intelligence applications, but it has also been observed in primates. In game theory, its application to (simpler) sub-games in order to find a solution to the game is called backward induction. In chess, it is called retrograde analysis, and it is used to generate table bases for chess endgames for computer chess. Backward chaining is implemented in logic programming by SLD resolution. Both rules are based on the modus ponens inference rule. It is one of the two most commonly used methods of reasoning with inference rules and logical implications – the other is forward chaining. Backward chaining systems usually employ a depth-first search strategy, e.g. Prolog.</p>
