<h2>Maslow's Need Hierarchy</h2>
<p>It is simply known as need hierarchy theory. This theory was proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper <strong>A Theory of Human Motivation</strong>. His theory suggests that people must satisfy five group of needs in order-physiological, security, social, esteem and self-actualization. The basis of Maslow's theory of motivation is that human beings are motivated by unsatisfied needs, and that certain lower needs need to be satisfied before higher needs can be addressed. These needs can be arranged in a hierarchy called 'Maslow's Needs Pyramid' or 'Maslow's Needs Triangle'. A person progresses step-by-step up this hierarchy.</p>

<h2>Herzberg's Motivation-Hygiene Theory</h2>
<p>This theory is also called two/dual factor theory. This theory was proposed by Fredrick Herzberg. According to Herzberg there are two factors that affect the motivation. <strong>Hygiene factor</strong>: are needed to ensure an employee does not become dissatisfies. They are also called <strong>dis-satisfiers</strong>. They are extrinsic factors. They are related to job context and environment. <strong>Motivation Factor</strong>: are needed in order to motive an employee into higher performance. They are also called satisfiers. They are intrinsic factors. They are related to job content. Motivation factors leads to satisfaction and motivates human. Some of the motivational factors are achievement, recognition, work itself, responsibility, advancement , growth, company policy ,supervision, relationship with boss, work conditions, salary, relationship with peers and security.</p>
