<h2>Baking Soda</h2>
<p>Baking Soda is 100% Bicarbonate. Baking soda can last for several years. Baking Soda is activated when it came in contact with heat, acid moisture. When baking soda is added, the product should be baked immediately. Allows cookies to spread. Baking soda is mostly used for Cookies Baking Soda have tangy taste when underused. Baking Soda have Bitter taste when overused. The easiest way to test baking soda to see if it is still good for leavening is to put some in a small bowl and add a little vinegar to it. (Make your own baking soda volcano!) If it bubbles up, it’s still good. Baking soda is a base chemical which it means it reacts to acids. Too much of it and you’ll end up with an inedible final product that taste like a bar soap or metal while if too little it won't raise as much. It’s generally used in combination with lemon juice, buttermilk, yogurt, cream of tartar, brown sugar and so on.</p>

<h2>Making Baking Powder from Baking Soda</h2>
<blockquote>
Combine 1/3 teaspoon baking soda with 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar and 1/8 teaspoon salt to make about teaspoon of single-acting baking powder.</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-baking-soda-and-baking-powder-together">
<h2>Using Baking Soda and Baking Powder Together</h2>
<p>Baking Soda is alkaline, and when mixed with acidic ingredients, its reaction causes bubbles of carbon dioxide to be released. It is this reaction, when trapped inside batter, that helps baked goods to rise.</p>
<p>Baking Powder, on the other hand, contains baking soda plus other acidic salts meant to react when they get wet or heated.</p>
<p>Some recipes call for both baking soda and powder. These recipes use the soda to offset the extra acidity in batters from ingredients such as buttermilk or molasses.</p>
<p>Baking soda cannot be omitted from these recipes without altering the flavor or making the baked goods tough.</p>
